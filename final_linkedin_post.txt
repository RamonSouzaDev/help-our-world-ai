👩‍⚕️ Engineering for Life: Introducing "Health Sentinel"

I am proud to unveil my latest systems engineering initiative: an AI-driven platform designed to modernize epidemiological surveillance in Brazil.

While my previous work focused on Aerospace Safety (ITA Project), I have now applied those same rigorous safety-critical standards to Public Health.

🏥 What is Health Sentinel?

It is a decentralized AI Command Center that processes biomedical telemetry (Heart Rate, SpO2) to detect early signs of Sepsis and correlate symptoms with active government outbreak data (Dengue, Flu).

⚙️ Technical & Legal Engineering:

This is not just a concept; it is a full engineering project ready for institutional review:

✅ AI Diagnostic Engine: Implementing qSOFA clinical criteria for sepsis detection.

✅ Legal Compliance: Fully aligned with LGPD (Lei 13.709) and ANVISA RDC 751 standards for SaMD (Software as a Medical Device).

✅ Government Integration: Built to interface with RNDS (National Health Data Network) using HL7 FHIR standards.

✅ Engineering Responsibility: Technical specifications drafted. Official ART registration with CREA-SP is scheduled for submission by March 2026.

🩺 My Personal Journey to Medicine:

This project is not just code; it is my bridge to the future. I am officially applying to **Medicine at UNIP (Universidade Paulista)** via ENEM 2026 (Ref: 20261202049), aiming to combine my Engineering background with Clinical Practice.

My goal is to be a doctor who understands the algorithm *and* the patient.

🌍 Impact:

The goal is to provide a tool for the Unified Health System (SUS) that moves from "Reactive" (treating the sick) to "Proactive" (predicting the outbreak).

I am opening the source code today to collaborate with Fiocruz, Butantan Institute, and the Ministry of Health.
