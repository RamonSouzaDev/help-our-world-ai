# Health Sentinel: AI for Global Web Health
### "Helping Our World through Intelligent Medicine"

**Project Status**: Active Development (2026)
**License**: MIT Open Source
**Compliance**: HIPAA / LGPD / WHO Standards

## 🌍 Mission
To democratize advanced medical diagnostics and epidemiological tracking using Artificial Intelligence. This project simulates a **National Health Guard System** that aggregates individual telemetry (wearables) and correlates it with Official Government Health Data (DataSUS/CDC) to predict outbreaks and save lives.

## 🧠 Core Architecture
The system is built on a high-availability Python architecture inspired by avionics safety standards ("We Can Fly" Heritage).

### 1. 🏥 Sentinel AI Engine (`src/ai/diagnostic.py`)
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Uses Isolation Forests (Unsupervised Learning) to detect deviations in vital signs.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Calculates probability of critical events (Cardiac Arrest, Sepsis Shock) before they happen.

### 2. ⌚ Bio-Telemetry Simulation (`src/sensors/biosensor.py`)
- **Multi-Parameter Tracking**: Simulates continuous streams of:
  - Heart Rate (BPM)
  - Blood Oxygen (SpO2%)
  - Systolic/Diastolic Pressure
  - Body Temperature
- **Physics-Based Variability**: Models circadian rhythms and stress responses for realistic data testing.

### 3. 🏛️ Government Data Link (`src/data/gov_integration.py`)
- **Official Statistics**: Integrates (simulated) data from Ministry of Health/DataSUS.
- **Population Health Context**: Compares individual vitals against regional morbidity rates to identify local outbreaks.

## 🛡️ Regulatory Compliance
- **Data Privacy**: All patient data is anonymized and encrypted (AES-256) before processing.
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs for every AI decision, ensuring "Black Box" explainability for medical review.

## 🚀 Quick Start
